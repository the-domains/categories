  It goes without saying that the most talked-about watch from Patek Philippe at
  Baselworld this year was the new 5930G World Timer, with its new combination
  of complications and somewhat polarizing design. However, there was another
  new watch this year - well, not a new watch, exactly, but a really handsome
  upgrade of an existing watch, and one of the most patrician watches Patek
  makes.
